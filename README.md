# Manifest Manager with Terraform

This project was developed during the SECOMP Hackathon at UFSCar, sponsored by MagaluCloud. The goal is to create a terminal for managing manifests, simplifying resource provisioning with Terraform.

## Project Objective

The terminal is designed to manage and provision resources with Terraform, providing quick access to pre-defined configurations. The project includes the following planned features:

- **MySQL Database**: Automatic configuration and provisioning of MySQL instances.
- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: Creation and management of VMs, with full support already implemented.
- **VPCs**: Configuration of virtual networks to organize and isolate resources.
- **Docker Containers**: Support for Docker containers, with two options:
  - Pre-configured containers for ease of use, requiring no advanced Docker knowledge.
  - Customizable `docker-compose` file for specific configurations, allowing more user control if preferred.

## Project Status

So far, we have completed the initial development of the terminal interface integrated with Terraform. The **VM creation** functionality is fully implemented. Next steps include finalizing the remaining features, particularly MySQL, VPCs, and Docker container support.

## Planned Features

1. **MySQL Configuration**: Support for creating and managing database instances.
2. **Full Docker Support**: Implementation of Docker container support, with both pre-configured setups and custom configurations via `docker-compose`.
3. **VPC Provisioning**: Management and provisioning of VPCs to organize and isolate resources.
